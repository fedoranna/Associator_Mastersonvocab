% This script can be used to run many Associator models consecutively
% You can modify the default parameters, e.g., to run atypical models
% Prerequisites: a folder ("folder") containing
% - all the functions
% - the vocabulary file called vocab_Masterson.xlsx
% - the parameter file called Associator_M_params1.mat
% - the RESULTS folder containing the RESULTS_Associator.xlsx file
% To try it, change the path to the "folder"!
